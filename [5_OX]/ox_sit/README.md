# ox_sit

This is a rework of the esx_sit script to use only the ox_lib and ox_target systems. This script allows you to sit on chairs, benches, beds, and other objects in the game world. You can configure the sit positions, animations, and keybinds in the config file.

## Dependencies

- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest)
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target/releases/latest)

## Installation

- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) or clone the repository.
- Extract the zip file and rename the folder to ox_sit.
- Copy the folder to your server resources directory.
- Add `ensure ox_sit` to your server.cfg file.
- Enjoy!

## Usage

- To sit on an object, press the keybind defined in the config file (default: X).
- To stand up, press the same keybind again.
- You can only sit on one object at a time.

## Showcase
